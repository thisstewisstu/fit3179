      <h2>Symbol Map of New South Wales</h2>
      <p>
        This map visualizes the location of heritage sites across New South Wales government schools. Each circle represents 
        a school site, categorized by colour for heritage type and size for their endorsed significance. A large majority of 
        heritage sites are clustered along the coastline, aligning with the fact that many school zones are also located 
        along the coast. A slider is provider to display sites of a selected endorsed significance for easier viewing.

      <h2>Number of Each Heritage Type Categorised by Endorsed Significance</h2>
      <p>
        This stacked bar chart shows the endorsed significance of heritage sites, classified by heritage type. The chart 
        allows users to filter by the type of heritage for a more focused analysis by using a drop-down menu. There is an 
        overwhelming number of heritage sites which are only of endorsed significance of 1, after each site has been 
        carefully assessed. This indicates that most sites are recognised as local heritage.

      <h3>Number of Each Heritage Type Overview</h3>
      <p>
        This donut chart shows the distribution of heritage types across all NSW government schools. A dropdown menu is provided 
        to filter by a specific school. The options are limited to schools which are located in the City of Blacktown because 
        the largest suburb in New South Wales is Blacktown with a population of 50,961. This provides additional information 
        should the local government of Blacktown decide to modify or list other heritage sites in this area and the impact it can 
        have on residents.
      </p>
      <p>Please note that while some suburbs and government area names are the same, in this context, Blacktown is the government 
        area name and the options are schools which may not necessarily be in the suburb of Blacktown.</p>
